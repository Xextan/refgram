# Foreword

## *What is a logical language?* 

A logical language, or “loglang”, is a constructed language which can be translated to and from formal logic notation; or, more broadly, any language with an unambiguous syntactic structure, such that any given sentence has exactly one possible “reading”, and therefore may be easily parsed by an algorithm like a programming language. Xextan belongs to the latter, broader category; while it may not always translate perfectly to formal logical notation, it is designed to allow ideas to be expressed freely, simply, and unambiguously.

While logical languages universally demand syntactic unambiguity, most do not strive for full semantic unambiguity, which can be achieved only by creating individual words for every atomic concept known in natural language. Xextan attempts to reach a compromise by deriving most of its core vocabulary from a modest yet not overly restrictive number of words, each of which represent an idea which is either functionally indivisible into more fundamental concepts or which is itself useful in deriving a large number of other concepts in an intuitive way.

The first logical language, Loglan, was created in an effort to determine whether the use of an unambiguous language could encourage people to think and act more rationally. After the language developed a sufficiently large community, disagreements over basic flaws in the language's design resulted in a schism which culminated in the creation of Lojban, a similar language project which ultimately achieved greater notoriety than its predecessor. Over time, many hapless idealists including myself found ourselves captivated by the utopian vision of Lojban and sought to master the language for purposes both intellectual and spiritual.

Upon achieving such mastery, however, we found ourselves profoundly unsatisfied at the limitations and oversights deeply embedded in the language we once thought to represent perfection in human expression. Just as those who came before us, we were able to observe and understand these flaws only after years of our lives spent living the language by engaging in conversation, participating in the community, and expressing ourselves through creative works.
Many of us fell away from the effort out of frustration, whether directed at the quandaries inherent in the design of the original logical languages or at the persistent gatekeeping and negativity which ran rampant in the community from its inception. And yet those of us who continued to hope against hope for that dream, who would build ever upward knowing that our lofty goal remained unreachable, carried on.

Unlike our predecessors, we found wisdom in the diversity of ideals and visions, all while recognizing the folly inherent in the pursuit of ultimate perfection. Most importantly, we discovered beauty and magic in the endless possibilities that lay before us as we gave form to pure imagination and weaved spirit into shapes and sounds. The language described in this book, Xextan, represents the culmination of my latest effort at achieving an impossible dream of my own.

Dear reader, thank you for joining me on this journey. I hope above all that I may pass along to you that same spark of inspiration through these pages that I found many years ago in the dreams of another.
